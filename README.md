This mod is for the game Gunner, HEAT, PC! (GHPC) and drastically reduces graphics quality to improve performance, especially on low-spec systems. This mod uses MelonLoader.

## Key Features

* **Automatic Graphics Settings:** Applies the lowest possible graphics settings when the game starts.
* **Removal of Non-Essential Objects:** Removes objects such as smoke, trees, visual effects, fog, grass, and bushes to reduce rendering load.
* **Hotkey Trigger:** Press the **F9** key in-game to reapply the low-quality settings and remove environmental objects. This is useful if you want to toggle or re-enable the mod during gameplay.
* **Application on Scene Load:** Automatically applies the low-quality settings every time a new scene is loaded.

## Installation

1.  Make sure you have **MelonLoader** installed for GHPC. You can download it from the [official MelonLoader website](https://melonloader.xyz/). Follow the installation instructions provided there.
2.  Download the `UltraLowGraphic.dll` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/your_username/your_repo/releases).
3.  Locate your GHPC installation folder. It's usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GHPC`.
4.  Open the `Mods` folder inside the GHPC installation folder. If the `Mods` folder doesn't exist, create a new folder named `Mods`.
5.  Copy the `UltraLowGraphic.dll` file into the `Mods` folder.

## Usage

After installing the mod, it will automatically activate when you launch GHPC through MelonLoader.

* When the game starts, you will see a message in the MelonLoader console indicating that the mod has loaded and the low-quality settings have been applied.
* You can press the **F9** key at any time during gameplay to reapply the low-quality settings and remove non-essential objects. A message will appear in the MelonLoader console each time you do this.
* The low-quality settings will also be applied automatically every time a new scene is loaded in the game.

## Important Notes

* This mod significantly reduces the game's graphics quality. Expect a decrease in texture detail, shadow quality, and other visual elements.
* The primary goal of this mod is to improve performance and frame rates on lower-specification systems.
* Using the **F9** hotkey can be useful if you want to re-enable the quality reduction after a game update or scene change that might restore some graphical elements.
* This mod removes objects based on keywords in their names. There may be some objects that are not removed if their names do not match the specified keywords.
